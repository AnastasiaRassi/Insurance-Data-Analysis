# Insurance-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes how various factors, such as body types, lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking), and environmental conditions, impact healthcare insurance premiums. The goal is to explore the relationship between these factors and the likelihood of developing chronic diseases, which affect the cost of medical treatment and insurance premiums.
